## How to Play

- Players start by choosing a difficulty level.
- The game will randomly select a number within a range depending on the chosen difficulty.
- Players guess the number, and the game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
- The number of guesses is tracked, and the player's result is stored in a Google Sheet.
